    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/headshot.jpg.JPG" alt="Lianna Churchill">
    <p>My name is Lianna Churchill and I'm a professional Technical Writer. I graduated Shepherd Hill Regional High School in 2015, where I was president of my a capella group, producer of my school's morning show, and a member of the Tri-M Honor Society and the National Art Honor Society. I've always had a passion for the arts and I love to read and write in my spare time. I've always exercised my creativity whenever I was able to, in personal and academic endeavors. After graduating from high school, I began attending UMass Amherst where I studied English and attained three certificates: Professional Writing and Techincal Communication, the Study and Practice of Writing, and Creative Writing. I was also a double minor in French and Sociology. I was been a member of the WMUA Social Marketing Team for two years and I consistently held a position on the Media, Copyediting, and Design Team for Jabberwocky, a student-run literary journal. I also worked as a writing tutor at the Writing Center on campus for three years. </p>
    <p style="height: 180px"> In the spring of 2018, I was fortunate enough to participate in a direct enrollment study abroad program at Diderot University in Paris, France. This experience was crucial in developing my French language skills, which I have been studying for eight years and continue to hone. Studying in France had been one of my biggest goals and finally achieving it meant that I could make new goals for myself. Once I began taking technical writing classes, I started to love working with technology to improve people's experiences and using language to communicate in different ways. I love conducting research and putting together data, as I find the proccess of creating new information to be exciting and valuable. I graduated from UMass Amherst in the spring of 2019 and obtained a career as a Technical Writer for Collins Aerospace in Westford, MA where I worked to develop and refine technical manuals for aerospace engineering. I then worked as a techincal writer at ChaosSearch, creating API and Saas cloud-based documentation for users, customers, and colleagues. Eventually I hope to go back to school for a Master's of Science in Sociology and achieve my ultimate goal of publishing a novel. </p>
