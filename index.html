        <p>I’m a technical writer, content designer, and knowledge manager.<br>
        Before I became all that, my first job ever was a library page at the library in my hometown. Since then I’ve worked in lots of different spaces: aerospace and defense, data lake architecture, and no-code app building.<br>
        User education and program adoption is the core of my work. I craft documentation and UX copy to guide users through tasks, no matter their level of experience. My passion for my career is helping communities understand ever-evolving technology to solve their problems.</p>
